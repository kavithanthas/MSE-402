## Project Overview
This repository documents the progress, methodologies, and collaboration efforts for our MSE 402 capstone project. Initially focused on an app-based design, we have shifted to a **backend optimization algorithm** for improving **route efficiency and fuel consumption** in rideshare operations.

## Project Scope and Goals
- **Optimization Model:** Transitioned from an app-based design to a **backend optimization algorithm**.  
- **Survey Integration:** Used **University of Waterloo survey data** to validate assumptions.  
- **Objectives:** Reduce **fuel consumption, improve route efficiency, and enhance user experience**.  
- **Expanded Constraints:** Consider **time windows, sub-tour elimination, and fuel efficiency metrics**.  
- **Risk Management:** Address **system downtime, algorithmic bias, cybersecurity threats, and adoption resistance**.  

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
| Team Member | Responsibility |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Kavithan Ranjagunathas** | Backend development, algorithm testing, documentation |
| **Liveesh Grewal** | Data collection, preprocessing, and model evaluation |
| **Dilraj Rai** | System architecture, testing, and deployment |
| **Nafis Huq** | Frontend integration, project management, and communication |

## Tools & Technologies
- **Task Management:** Trello, Google Drive, Notion  
- **Development:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy  
- **Testing:** Unit tests, benchmarking scripts  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub  
- **Communication:** Google Meet, Slack, Email  

## Meeting Norms
- **Weekly Meetings:** Every **Friday from 5-6 PM (Google Meet)**.  
- **Agenda Rotation:** Shared responsibility among team members.  
- **Documentation:** Nafis records and uploads meeting notes.  

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|----------------------|
| System Downtime | High | Medium | Implement failover systems |
| Bias in Algorithm | High | Medium | Conduct fairness audits and use diverse datasets |
| Cybersecurity Threats | High | Medium | Use encryption, security updates, and MFA |
| Adoption Resistance | Medium | High | Conduct user testing and feedback loops |
